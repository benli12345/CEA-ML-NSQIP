This code was used to develop and evaluate machine learning models for the prediction of 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or death) following carotid endarterectomy using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Database in the manuscript entitled "Predicting major adverse cardiovascular events following carotid endarterectomy using machine learning algorithms" by Li and colleagues. The code was written in R verison 4.2.1.
